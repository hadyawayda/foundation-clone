		<h5 className="baseline-paragraph font-extrabold text-center mt-12">Established in 2005 and chaired by Tanya Saad√© Zeenny, the CMA CGM Foundation addresses social needs and utility. Mirroring the CMA CGM Group, a leading family-run business in transportation and logistics, the Foundation is driven by a sense of responsibility, a spirit of solidarity, and a passion for entrepreneurship. The Foundation focuses on two key missions: humanitarian aid and education for all. Facing crises, the Foundation leverages the expertise in transport and logistics solutions of the CMA CGM Group to deliver essential humanitarian supplies. It also supports access to quality education, professional training and integration, as well as educational and social innovation. To date, the Foundation has transported 63,000 tons of humanitarian aid to 93 countries, supported over 550 educational projects in France, Lebanon, and around the world, and assisted 55 entrepreneurs through its social incubator, Le Phare.</h5>
